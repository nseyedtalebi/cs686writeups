\begin{abstract}
Random patterns in space are the subject of study in the branch of mathematics called "stochastic geometry." Using these tools, one can answer questions in a diverse array of fields ranging from astronomy to forestry. This report is structured like the presentation mentioned in the title and begins by introducing spatial point processes, hereafter just "point processes."  A fundamental and important kind of point process called the stationary Poisson Point Process (PPP) has properties that make it useful for both building mathematical models and studying more complex processes. The points in a point process can be partitioned into two sets based on some given probability in a transformation called "thinning." The distribution of nearest neighbors to a hypothetical "typical" point provides a kind of spatial average. Point processes have applications in simulating and planning wireless networks.
